# Fetch and Render API Data
## Fetch and Render API Data Exercise
<img src="reactgetdataimg.png" width='300'/><br>
This web page uses React. It fetches API data from the Art Institute of Chicago and renders up to ten art images along with their titles and dates according to the collection selected from the dropdown list. The user can look through the ten items using the bootstrap rendered buttons below the image.
To run this on your machine, download the files, start an http-server for the folder within which the files reside, and load the .html file on your browser by typing localhost:8080.
Additional functionality that would be helpful to a user for future iterations would be to include multiple fields of entry to specify by artist and by year, and to display more than one image at a time.<br><br>
